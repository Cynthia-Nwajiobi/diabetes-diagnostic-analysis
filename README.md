# diabetes-diagnostic-analysis
### 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes a diabetes dataset collected from Medical City Hospital and Al-Kindy Teaching Hospital in Iraq.
The dataset includes medical and laboratory variables such as age, gender, blood sugar levels, BMI, creatinine ratio, urea, cholesterol profile, HbA1c, and diabetes class (Diabetic, Non-Diabetic, Pre-Diabetic).

#### The goal of this project was to:

- Explore demographic and clinical risk factors for diabetes.
- Use Google Sheets/Excel PivotTables and visualizations to uncover patterns.
- Translate findings into a health data story for public health advocacy.

### 🗂️ Dataset

* Source: Patient files from the Iraqi healthcare system (Medical City Hospital & Al-Kindy Teaching Hospital).
* Size: 1000 patient records.

#### Key Features:
- Patient ID
- Age, Gender
- BMI
- Blood Sugar, HbA1c
- Creatinine, Urea
- Cholesterol profile (Total, LDL, HDL, VLDL, TG
- Diabetes Class (Diabetic / Pre-Diabetic / Non-Diabetic)

### 🔍 Methods & Tools

- Tool: Google Sheets (Excel)

**Techniques:**
- Data cleaning and standardization
- PivotTables to summarize trends
- PivotCharts for visualization
- Helper columns for grouping:

-Age Groups (e.g., 20–29, 30–39, …)

-BMI Categories (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese)

### 📊 Key Findings

- **Age and Diabetes:** Most diabetic patients were between 50–69 years. Out of 844 diabetic patients, 738 (87%) fell into this age group.
- **BMI and Diabetes:** Higher BMI strongly correlated with higher likelihood of diabetes.
- **HbA1c and Blood Sugar:** Diabetic patients had significantly higher HbA1c averages compared to Pre-Diabetic and Non-Diabetic groups.

### 🌍 Health Data Story
This analysis informed a full narrative issue of Health Data Stories, a storytelling initiative that uses data to advocate for better health policies in Africa and beyond.
The story contextualizes Iraqi data with global diabetes trends, BMI risk evidence, and patient stories. Read here: <https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/diagnostic-analysis-diabetes-what-iraqi-lab-data-world-nwajiobi-hwqff>

### 🚀 Next Steps
- Extend analysis using SQL for database querying.
- Compare Iraqi trends with global datasets (e.g., WHO, IDF Diabetes Atlas).
- Build a reproducible dashboard (Tableau/Power BI) for broader insights.
